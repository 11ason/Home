## About Fuji Shibukura Flower Festival

The Fuji Shibukura Flower Festival is a celebrated event held annually at the base of Mount Fuji. It features a stunning array of blooming flowers, including the iconic shibazakura (moss phlox), which creates a sea of pink, purple, and white hues. The festival also includes local food vendors, cultural performances, and various activities for visitors of all ages.
