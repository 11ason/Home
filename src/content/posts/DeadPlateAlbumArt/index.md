## What?  
I’ve recently been fascinated by RachelDrawsThis’s unique art style and the character design in "Dead Plate." (and their other works). So When i found out there was an official soundtrack, I knew I had to design a cover for it, something that I could display on my shelf that showed of the game and it's beautiful art. The game’s eerie yet charming atmosphere, combined with the intriguing characters of Rody & Vincent, really drew me in and inspired this piece.

## Game Overview  
"Dead Plate" is a 2D restaurant tycoon-themed RPG horror game with visual novel and point-and-click elements, set in 1960s France. The game centers around Rody, a spirited waiter who must navigate the challenges of running a high-end bistro owned by the renowned chef Vincent Charbonneau. Players are forced to balance serving customers and optimizing profits while unraveling the darker mysteries lurking beneath the surface. The blend of restaurant management with horror and visual novel elements creates a tense and immersive experience that keeps you hooked from start to finish.

## Why?  
I wanted this design to capture the essence of the game, highlighting both the mundane and the mysterious. The interior art showcases key moments from the game that dispaly the eerie events that unfold. Designing this was a great experience, and I’m excited to share it as part of my portfolio and express how much I love this game.
