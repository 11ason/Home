This Project was designed in Visual Studio Code and uses open-source software designed by Saicaca for more information about the software used in this site go [here](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari)


## What?
11ason.space is a platform designed specifically to my needs, it features a archive of all of my publicly displayed works and acts as a portfolio of what i can do, ontop of being (in my opinion) visually stunning it is extremley optimized to fit my workflow, it was designed with the future in mind and i plan to continue to update this site with all of my future work.

## Why?
I created this site as a way of collecting & consolidating of my work into one single easy to use place, before this site i had a FTP server that was in charge of hosting a large folder of all the work that im currently displaying, this meant that in order to view my projects you had to first go to a specifc ip address and search through layers of folders to find a project for example this is what the path to one of my projects used to look like: 
E:\projects\CD Album Art\Charli XCX\brat\Renders\BratAlbumArt.PNG
now the same file can be viewed on any device anywhere by going to:
https://11ason.space/posts/bratalbumart/ or https://11ason.space/archive/
This makes showing off my work sooo much easier and more enjoyable for both me and the viewer weather that be a peer, mentor, company, or even just a random person who found my work.
if your any of those people thanks for checking this out!

## Wrapping it up I promise
Anyways im constantly working on updating this site (it's been up for about 24 hours at this point and I have already made 62 commits to the github repo for this site) please stay tunned for my content i post and if you like it feel free to contact me on instagram [@11as0n](Https://instagram.com/11as0n)
