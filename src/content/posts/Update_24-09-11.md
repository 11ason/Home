## Game Progress
:::warning[Spoilers]
This section of the post reveals a lot of information that a player of the game shouldn't know about before finishing the game, if you're reading this in the future play the game before reading this.

This is a screenshot of our canva whiteboard that i have been adding completed work to (As of September 10th 2024)

We wanted to mix a mundane service industry job with something exciting and a little scary so we settled on the game taking place in a old run down theatre, we decided that an interesting way to incorporate a horror element would be to add ghost that haunt the movie theatre and have them be the "enemy" in the game (I can go into more detail about this later). We also wanted to give the game a deeper meaning, i ghosting hunting game is fun but not memorable. So we connected a few ideas throughout the game.

1. The game takes place over seven days (monday-sunday) 
2. Theres seven ghosts (one per day) 
3. The seven ghosts connect to the seven stages of grief 

We want each ghost to represent a different stage of grief and connect their stage of grief to the player in so form, our current idea is to connect the grief the player is facing about the passing of there sibling to the grief of the ghosts but we are still not locked in on this idea.

My friend whose the lead artist has drawn up some character sketches (she will be in charge of most assets in the game) im planning to take some of the drawing workload off her shoulders once i feel comfortable drawing the characters in the way i want them to look in the game.

## Learning Art

I also have been trying to learn how to draw (I have been using a lot of reference art by a creator called racheldrawsthis so i can learn how to draw similar to her) i would love to recreate a similar visual experience in my game to rachels game which i have been obbsedd with since finding out about her work.

this is something i was working on while trying to understand her technique, these drawings are meant to replicate her  work therefor im not claiming them as my work because without a  referance to follow for each aspect of the drawing i would have been infinitly lost. this has been my first experience  with drawing in my free time as a hobby rather than in school for a class.

I have also spent my time learning anatomy and  perspective which has been frustration to sya the least, but it's quite rewarding to see the work pay off when you finally nail it, i'm not exactly where i want to be in termsofskill but i don't plan to give up and i do plan to keep working on improving these skills.
