Hi everyone,

I wanted to share an update on what's going on in my life and what you can expect in the near future.

## What's Happening?

September is right around the corner, which means school is starting again. This means I'll need to focus more on my schoolwork and less on personal projects. However, this doesn't mean I’ll stop posting—if anything, I think this will give me more content to share, even if the situation isn't perfect.

## Pros

1. One of the benefits of going back to school is that I'll be able to post some of my schoolwork that involves graphic design.

2. Another pro is that part of my coursework this year includes developing a video game.

## Cons

But here's the downside:

1. Although I’ll have work to post, it won’t be a lot (I only have two classes where I'll be using graphic design tools), and it won’t be personal. While I love design, the projects will be completely oriented around the assignments, so they might not fully showcase what I can do.

2. As excited as I am about doing game design as part of my schoolwork, it's also a bit terrifying. Turning something I do in my free time into a graded skill is genuinely intimidating, and I can only hope it goes well.

## The Fun Part

Despite the challenges, having the opportunity to do something I'm passionate about and get school credit for it is amazing. So, let’s talk a little about it.

### What is it?

I'm still in the planning stages, but with the help of my friend (the artist for the game), we’ve been brainstorming what we want in the game and where we want the story to go. Here’s what we have so far:

Your name is Ethan. You're a new hire at a movie theater known for its re-runs of old movies. You work alongside your childhood best friend and Bryce, the owner's nephew. In the afternoon, you're in charge of selling tickets, taking drink & popcorn orders, and cleaning up the theater with your friend. But once it’s showtime, and your friend swaps shifts with Bryce, you begin exploring the theater and the secrets it holds. You’ve heard rumors that the place is haunted, but you never believed them—until you saw them with your own eyes.
