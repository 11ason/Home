# About
Hi, My name is Mason
I'm a junior high school student passionate about graphic design, web development, and video game development. With three years of experience in graphic design, two in Python scripting, and one in web development, I've honed my skills across various tools and languages, including C++, Java, Python, Luma, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro. I enjoy bringing creative ideas to life, whether through coding or design.
