Hey,
So  this is the first planning post I've made for this site, recently I have been really into designing cd album art (As you can probably tell already) so a lot of my time has went into making these, and as much as I love making them I also want to do some new things, aswell as release some much needed updates to my other projects. So to give myself things to do I'm planning some future projects. 

The ETA's given to these projects will probably change over time as I find motivation to do different projects and I will most likely add more to this list but im going to try to stay true to my word.

## In Progress
Troye Sivan Album Art | ETA: Within the next week
>Bloom | Planning Post
>
>Something To Give Each Other | Rendering

## Upcoming
>Elevator Hitch Album Art | Planning | ETA: Within the next 2 weeks

>Rewrite the descriptions for projects older than 1 month.| ETA: Within  the next month

## Upcoming | No ETA for these yet
**Website Updates**
>Stars UI for whole site

**SpotifyNowPlaying**
>Finalize Lyrics Support | Curently in beta

**New Roblox Game**
>I know that I want to get back into making games but i need to plan out the game before realease an eta.
